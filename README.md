# Code Styles

## Summary
IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio code style settings I use in all of my projects. The setup for this repo was taken from Square's [code style repo](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles).

## Instructions
* Run `install.sh` on Unix, `install.bat` on Windows
* Restart IntelliJ / Android Studio 
* Within IntelliJ / Android Studio project settings, change the code style for the project you want.
